#README

There appears to be not much here yet!

This is a repo for the Goose Buster -- a robot designed to scare away geese so they don't wake you up at 5 am every morning duking it out with each other, or send your coworkers to the hospital from an assault.

Currently it is just a 4wd robot platform.

Potential features to add:
 - Pan/tilt servos for observation camera (NV/thermal) or Nerf-style projectile launcher
 - Relay control for activation of attached device
 - Digital downlink for enhanced cameras (FPV for control will probably stay analog for speed)
 - Target tracking and PID control for the PT appendage! (reach goal -- maybe model off iSpy camera software which attempted to do this in a stationary setting)
